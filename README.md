# Amazon Alexa Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of Amazon Alexa products using sentiment analysis. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative and gain insights into customer satisfaction using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of Amazon Alexa product reviews, including text reviews and sentiment labels (positive/negative). The data is preprocessed before model training.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
